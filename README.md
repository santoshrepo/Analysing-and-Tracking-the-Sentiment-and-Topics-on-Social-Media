The Tweets were extracted from the Oneplus timeline was very much interesting and can see the progress the company has made since November 2018. There were trending hashtags, i.e, Oneplus 6T, Oneplus 7 pro phone. The sentimental analysis was done on Vader to find the sentiment of each tweet and understand the timeline the tweet was extracted.
